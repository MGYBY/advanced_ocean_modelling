FORTRAN CODE FOR EXERCISE 14

The code uses a forcing value of eta_river of 0.5 m.  The reader is encouraged to
test other values.

The turbulence closure scheme is formulated in the "eddy" subroutine found in the
file "sub.f95". The scalar array "c1" is used to predict age distribution.
    
SCILAB SCRIPT FOR EXERCISE 14

The script "Exercise 14a.sce" produces an animation of the density and flow fields. 
The second script "Exercise 14b.sce" creates an animation of the evolution of water age
together with the tidally averaged flow field.
