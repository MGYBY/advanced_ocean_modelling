FORTRAN CODE FOR EXERCISE 8

The code already contains a prediction of Eulerian tracer concentration needed for Exercise 9.
The random-number generator is formulated in another subroutine contains in the file "random.f95".
This file must be included in the compiling procedure.

Note that Courant numbers for the density prediction are the same as for the 
concentration prediction and, therefore, do not need to be calculated twice.
