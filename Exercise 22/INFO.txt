FORTRAN CODE FOR EXERCISE 22

In a first step, the reader has to create a bathymetry map stored in a file called "topo.dat" that is needed for the simulation code.
This is done with the program "BathCreator.f95".

The simulation code produces three different outputs. Files with the ending "S" refer to surface distributions, those with "B" to bottom
distributions, and those with "V" to vertical transects.

SCILAB SCRIPTS FOR EXERCISE 22

The script "Bathy.sce" produces a graph of the bathymetry. The script "Exercise 22a.sce" creates an animation of surface and bottom
Eulerian concentration fields together with the lateral velocity field. The svript "Exercise 22b.sce" produces an animation of the density
field and transverse flow in a vertical transect cutting across the middle of the strait.
