Files named with the ending "S" are surface distributions; those with "V" are vertical transects. 


SCILAB SCRIPTS FOR EXERCISE 20

The script "Exercise 20a.sce" produces an animation of the surface density and flow fields. The script
 "Exercise 20b.sce" produces an animation of density and transverse flow in a vertical cross-section cutting
across the centre of the model domain.
