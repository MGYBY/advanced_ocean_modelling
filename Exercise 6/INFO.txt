FORTRAN CODE FOR EXERCISE 6

The random-number generator is formulated in another external module in the file "random.f95". This file needs to be compiled and embedded
in the executable as well. As before, this is done in two steps.

Step 1: g95 -c param.f95 sub.f95 random.f95
Step 2: g95 -o ex6.exe main.f95 param.o sub.o random.o

 
SCILAB SCRIPT FOR EXERCISE 6

The "champ" function is used to add flow vectors to the plot. Showing this at all (101 times 51 = many) location would result in tiny arrows
that can only be spotted with difficulty (or requires a magnifying glass).  Instead of this, an averaging procedure is included in order to
reduce the number of arrows shown.
