FORTRAN CODE FOR EXERCISE 4

This code includes a full implementation of density advection and the nonlinear terms.
To this end, the TVD scheme is formulated in general form as a subroutine with an
input array called "B".  Courant numbers are calculated in the "dyn" subroutine prior
to calling this routine.  The limiting function is formulated as a FORTRAN function
named "PSI".  Variable bathymetry is not implemented in this code, but it should be easy
for the reader to do this, if wanted.  


SCILAB SCRIPT FOR EXERCISE 4

When using variable bathymetry, the reader should try to add a mask of this bathymetry
via use of the "xfpoly" function.  Tip of the day: You can look at individual frames
of the animation by typing "for n = 40".
