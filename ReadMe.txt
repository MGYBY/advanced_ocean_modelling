Dear User

I have recently update all SciLab scripts for compatibility with the latest SciLab version (5.5.1). Please reference this book if you use for scientific research.

Happy modelling, Jochen Kaempf, Adelaide (March 2015)


ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE

Knowledge of basic FORTRAN and SciLab scripting is expected as a prerequisite for the exercises included in this book.
Readers who need more training are encouraged to study my textbook "Ocean Modelling for Beginners" (published at
Springer). Many additional free resources are available on the Internet, such as "Scilab for Real Dummies" (http://www.heikell.fi/downloads.htm).
