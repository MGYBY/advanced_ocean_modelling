FORTRAN CODE FOR EXERCISE 1

The "MODE" parameter selects from different settings for vertical eddy viscosities in the subroutine EDDY which
can be found in the file "sub.f95".

SCILAB SCRIPT FOR EXERCISE 1   

The FORTRAN code needs to be compiled and run first before the SciLab script can find the input file needed for the animation.
Some parameters of the SciLab script may require fine tuning dependent on the screen resolution of your computer.
